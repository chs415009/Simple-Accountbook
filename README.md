**Simple-Accountbook** is a desktop financial management application developed as an academic project using C# and .NET Windows Forms. This project demonstrates GUI development, multi-form architecture, and basic database operations in a Windows environment.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **User Authentication**: Login system with basic account creation
- **Multi-form Application**: Demonstrates navigation between different interfaces
- **Transaction Management**: Add, view, and delete financial records
- **Category System**: Organized expense and income categories
- **Date Selection**: Calendar interface for transaction dating
- **Search Functionality**: View transactions by category
- **Input Validation**: Form validation with user feedback

## ðŸ“¥ Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Windows operating system
- Visual Studio (2017 or later recommended)
- .NET Framework 4.5+

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/chs415009/simple-accountbook.git
   ```
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio:
   ```
   AccoutingAPP.sln
   ```
3. Build and run the application directly from Visual Studio

## ðŸš€ Application Workflow

### User Authentication (Form 1)
The application starts with a login interface:

- **First-time users**: Enter desired username and password to register
- **Returning users**: Enter credentials to access your account
- **Validation**: System checks for empty fields and correct password input

### Main Dashboard (Form 2)
After successful authentication, you'll access the main dashboard with three primary functions:

- **é›¢é–‹ (Exit)**: Save and close the application
- **æ–°å¢ž (Add)**: Navigate to the transaction entry form
- **æª¢è¦– (View)**: Navigate to the transaction viewing and management form

### Transaction Entry (Form 3)
The transaction entry form allows you to add new financial records:

1. **Date Selection**: Choose year, month, and day sequentially for accurate dating
2. **Category Selection**: Choose from hierarchical categories for expenses or income
3. **Description**: Add details about your transaction
4. **Amount**: Enter the transaction amount
   - For expenses: Positive numbers are automatically converted to negative
   - For income: Must be entered as positive numbers
